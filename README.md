# Nested ToDo List Application

## Installation Requirements:
- Node.js
- Ionic CLI

## Functionality Summary:
The user is able to add, edit, delete and mark tasks as complete. Additionally, the user can add a sub-task to any other task that has already been created. Included is also a progress bar that indicates the completion level of all tasks that can be updated at the push of a button.

## Additional Notes:
The project is an Ionic React project and thus Reactjs and Typescript are used. All of the code is included in this GitHub repo except for the `node_modules` directory much must be added to the project before runnning it. This can be done automatically using the Ionic extension in VSCode. The application can then be run using `$ ionic serve` or alternatively run through the Ionic extension.
